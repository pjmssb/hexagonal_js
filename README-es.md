# Yet another Ports & Adapters (a.k.a. Hexagonal Architecture) example

I've talked now and then to several development teams about the Ports & Adapters patter and the hexagonal architecture. The usual hexagone showing where the models and use cases are located and the ports showing how beautyfully connect now to a PostgreSQL database and then it is migrated almost effortesly to a No-SQL database says nothing to them. 

I feel I've failed to convey the advantage of this architecture to the more junior team members. The seniors, can remember may cases where this architecture could save them of hours of tedious labor to update a dependency or to migrate to a different SMS or e-mail service provider or to change the repository technology.

As a result, afters 45 minute of hearing me the people that already knew about hexagonal architectura gets nothing and the people thant didnÂ´t knew about hexagonal architecture get confused. They have a new tool that forces them to code more (a port and an adapter) for something they can resolve in 1 o2 lines of code. 

A no-win - no-win situation... :-S

## Now what?
OK, the idea is to create a new example 
## Technologies used in this program

Yes, the technology is important to show this. I feel it is easier to show the implementation of ports & adapters in a typed language as Java or C++.
